Syntax between pthon and java: not strong type
function is a keyword in javascript, reserved but not used in java alternatively
function fname(x,y) -the variable type can vary in parameter
{
  return x+y; - can be any type as long as the plus sign makes sense
}

var = fname function(x,y)
{
  return x+y;
}

Variable:
var x=1; -x is visible globally
let y=2; accessible locally
Javascript can be embedded in a html document or stand only but linked to 1+ html document, similar to css

Javascript syntax is like Java

let i =1000;
i %= 2;   <===> i = i%2;
i += 3; <===> i = i+3;
Don't say i equals i+3 for i=i+3!
say i gets i+3
say i gets updated to i+3
or i is incremented by 3
