Syntax between pthon and java: not strong type
function is a keyword in javascript, reserved but not used in java alternatively
function fname(x,y) -the variable type can vary in parameter
{
  return x+y; - can be any type as long as the plus sign makes sense
}

var = fname function(x,y)
{
  return x+y;
}

Variable:
var x=1; -x is visible globally
let y=2; accessible locally
Javascript can be embedded in a html document or stand only but linked to 1+ html document, similar to css

Javascript syntax is like Java

let i =1000;
i %= 2;   <===> i = i%2;
i += 3; <===> i = i+3;
Don't say i equals i+3 for i=i+3!
say i gets i+3
say i gets updated to i+3
or i is incremented by 3

parseFloat("abc") is a NaN, stands for not a number

=== is not in java
x === y means x and y refer to the same memory location
x == y the values happen to be the same

In java: x == y <===> JS ===
x.equals(y) <===> JS ===

if (x == "2") or if (x.equals("2"))
JS's x == "3" <===> Java's x.equals("3"

if (32) <=== if (true)
if (0) <===> if (false)
if ("abc") <===> if (true)
if ("") <===> if (false)

<script>
let sum =0;
for(let i=1; i<= 100; i++)
  sum+=i;
document.write("The sum of 1st 100 integers =" + sum);
console.log("The sum of 1st 100 integers =" + sum);
</script>
save as html file
